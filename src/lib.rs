//! A simple crate that defines the types used by the Minecraft version manifest.
//!
//! This crate deliberately does not include any code to actually fetch from the endpoints, as to
//! not tie it to any particular HTTP client.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Basic usage of this crate would involve fetching the version manifest from the URL defined in
//! VERSION_MANIFEST_URL, and then fetching the version JSON file from the URL defined in the
//! Version.url field for the corresponding version.
//!
//! No examples are provided, as the exact usage will depend on the HTTP client used to fetch the
//! manifest and the version JSON files.
//!
//! ## Disclaimer
//!
//! This project is not affiliated with Minecraft, Mojang or Microsoft.
//!
//! All product and company names are trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of their respective
//! holders. Use of them does not imply any affiliation with or endorsement by them.
